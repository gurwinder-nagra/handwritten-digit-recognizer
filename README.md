## Introduction

This project implements a Handwritten Digit Recognizer using a pretrained model on the MNIST dataset. The Gradio library is utilized to create a user-friendly GUI that allows users to draw digits and receive real-time recognition results.

## Features

- Pretrained model on the MNIST dataset.
- Gradio GUI for drawing digits and getting instant recognition results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Gradio

```bash
pip install gradio==3.50.2
Installation
Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/gurwinder-nagra/handwritten-digit-recognizer.git
Navigate to the project directory:


cd handwritten-digit-recognizer
Install dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the Gradio app with the following command:

python app.py
Visit the provided URL in your web browser to interact with the Handwritten Digit Recognizer. Draw a digit on the canvas, and the model will recognize it in real time.
